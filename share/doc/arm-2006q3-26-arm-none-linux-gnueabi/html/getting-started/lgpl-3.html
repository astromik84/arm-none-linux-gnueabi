    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
    everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
    ordinary General Public License).</p><p>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    &#8220;<span class="quote">copyright</span>&#8221; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p><p>&lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
